        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Directly, Nigiri translates to “two fingers”. As the name implies, this is a small, delicious treat that features a thinly-sliced drapery of raw fish, laid over a cluster of sweet and salty vinegared rice.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>330 g Fresh Steamed Rice</li>
            <li>25 ml Rice Vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2-1 tbsp Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>3 slices Fresh Tuna Belly</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Ikura</li>
            <li>3 slices Fresh Salmon</li>
            <li>3 slices Boiled Octopus</li>
            <li>3 slices Tamagoyaki</li>
            <li>6 Sweet Shrimp</li>
            <li>Toasted Nori Seaweed</li>
            <li>Cucumbers</li>
            <li>Sushi Ginger</li>
            <li>Wasabi</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, slice the boiled octopus using a diagonal cut.</li>

            <li>Slice it across the grain to give it a better texture.</li>

            <li>Slice the fresh salmon diagonally.</li>

            <li>Cut off a 5mm (0.2”) slice of tamagoyaki.</li>

            <li>Next, add the rice vinegar to the ice water. The vinegar has a sterilizing effect and wetting your hands will help keep the rice from sticking to them.</li>

            <li>Put a small amount of wasabi on the sushi rice.</li>

            <li>And place 2 amaebi shrimp onto it.</li>

            <li>Likewise, place the octopus slice onto the rice. Gently press the octopus and the rice together.</li>

            <li>Next, make the Gunkanmaki for the salmon roe also known as ikura. Wrap the side of the rice with the nori strip. With a rice grain, close the end of the nori.</li>

            <li>Garnish with the cucumber slices. And spoon the ikura onto it.</li>

            <li>Wet your hands again and loosely shape about 20g (0.7 oz) of sushi rice into a ball. Hold the tuna slice with another hand and add the wasabi to it.</li>

            <li>Then, place the rice onto the tuna and flip it over.</li>

            <li>Arrange the shape to give the sushi its signature look.</li>

            <li>Likewise, make the salmon sushi. You can also sear the salmon or top with sliced onion and mayonnaise.</li>

            <li>Finally, shape the rice into an oval. Place the tamagoyaki onto it.</li>

            <li>Wrap the sushi with the 12cm (4.7”) nori strip crosswise.</li>

            <li>Gari, sliced ginger root pickled with sweet vinegar is considered an essential condiment for sushi presentation. Ginger has a sterilizing effect and will also help to warm you up.</li>
