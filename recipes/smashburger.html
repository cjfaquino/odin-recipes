        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Smashburger is cooked over high heat with a lot of pressure, which helps the beef develop a deep, rich crust. The browning process that happens is officially called the maillard reaction. The end result is delicious caramelized flavor and a burger that cooks quickly and doesn’t dry out. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pickle juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon diced pickle</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>1 pound 80/20  ground chuck</li>
            <li>4 potato hamburger buns</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 head green leaf lettuce, washed and dried</li>
            <li>1 medium tomato, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 medium red onion, sliced</li>
            <li>6 slices American cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Make the copycat smash sauce:</p>
                <p>In a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, mustard, pickle juice, and diced pickles. Set aside until you’re ready to assemble your burgers. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Make the burger seasoning mix:</p>
                <p>In another small bowl combine the kosher salt, black pepper, and seasoned salt.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Prepare the burgers:</p>
                <p>Loosely divide the ground beef into four even balls. Season the balls of beef with a 1/8 teaspoon burger seasoning mix. Don’t worry about completely covering them. You can add more seasoning when they are cooking. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Cook the smashburgers:</p>
                <p>Wrap a heavy skillet (cast iron works well) with some foil, you will use this to smash the burgers. I use a smaller 8-inch cast iron skillet, but any smaller size will work.</p>
                <p>Turn on the fan over the stove and open a window to help with air flow.</p>
                <p>In a large skillet or griddle (I do not recommend using non-stick) set over medium-high heat add one tablespoon of butter. Once the butter has melted, add the beef balls.</p>
                <p>Place the foil wrapped skillet or a spatula over the beef balls and smash them into flat disks. Smash each burger for 10 seconds, one at a time, applying a lot of pressure to it. Repeat until all the burgers are smashed.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Season burgers with more mix and continue to cook:</p>
                <p>Season the smashburgers with another 1/8 teaspoon burger seasoning mix. Allow them to continue to cook for about 90 seconds until the juices start to bubble from the burger. Use a sturdy metal spatula to flip the burgers, being sure to scrap up any caramelization. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Add cheese to the burgers:</p>
                <p>After you’ve flipped the burgers, add cheese (I like 1 1/2 slices per burger) and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, until burgers are cooked to desired doneness, usually medium. The burger is so thin that there’s no need to check temperature. It will be done if the burger has a good caramelization on the outside. You can continue to cook for another 30 seconds if you want a very well done burger. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Toast the burger buns:</p>
                <p>While burgers cook, toast the buns. In a large skillet over medium heat add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the buns, cut side down, and toast for 30 seconds, until golden. Repeat until all buns are toasted. If you have a griddle, you can toast the buns alongside the burgers. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Build and serve the smashburgers:</p>
                <p>Build a smashburger by adding some sauce, approximately 1 tablespoon, to the bottom of the burger bun. Add lettuce over the top of the sauce, then add a smashburger, and finally top with sliced red onion and tomato. Continue until all smashburgers are assembled.</p>
                <p>Serve immediately with fries and a cold drink.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
